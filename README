This is the ICFP 2012 entry for Invisible Imp, a.k.a. T. Alexander Popiel.
I am working as a team of only one person, both to reduce communication
overhead and because I cannot find anybody local with the same dedication
to the contest that I have.

This is the first year that I'm doing the contest in what is arguably a
functional languange; this year, I'm using Scala.  Huzzah!

Random notes:
* I'm using maven, just because I'm using it at work, and it's a convenient
  way to make sure that all the dependent jars I feel like pulling in actually
  end up in my submission image.  To compile from source, 'mvn compile'.

* The very first significant decision I made was to do map updates in place,
  to save on memory consumption and memory copies.  This does mean that for
  backtracking, I'm going to have to replay move sequences... but I suspect
  that will be less expensive in the long run than tons of memory copies.

* The second significant decision was to express map update in terms of the
  destination cells instead of the source cells.  In the process, I introduced
  a new cell state for "a rock _was_ here just a moment ago", but eliminated
  the need for a prior image of the map.  I have a second pass during update
  to clean up the dust of moving rocks.

This is about when I started.

This is about when I paused for lunch and a bit of TV.

About when I resumed to start the major refactor of State construction

Pausing to lie down for a bit.  Refactor complete, works as a scoring machine

Back.  Going to write some unit tests, of all things.
