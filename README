This is the ICFP 2012 entry for Invisible Imp, a.k.a. T. Alexander Popiel.
I am working as a team of only one person, both to reduce communication
overhead and because I cannot find anybody local with the same dedication
to the contest that I have.

This is the first year that I'm doing the contest in what is arguably a
functional languange; this year, I'm using Scala.  Huzzah!

Random notes:
* I'm using maven, just because I'm using it at work, and it's a convenient
  way to make sure that all the dependent jars I feel like pulling in actually
  end up in my submission image.  To compile from source, 'mvn compile'.

* The very first significant decision I made was to do map updates in place,
  to save on memory consumption and memory copies.  This does mean that for
  backtracking, I'm going to have to replay move sequences... but I suspect
  that will be less expensive in the long run than tons of memory copies.

* The second significant decision was to express map update in terms of the
  destination cells instead of the source cells.  In the process, I introduced
  a new cell state for "a rock _was_ here just a moment ago", but eliminated
  the need for a prior image of the map.  I have a second pass during update
  to clean up the dust of moving rocks.

This is about when I started.

Fri Jul 13 14:00:00 PDT 2012
This is about when I paused for lunch and a bit of TV.

Fri Jul 13 15:30:00 PDT 2012
About when I resumed to start the major refactor of State construction

Fri Jul 13 17:39:45 PDT 2012
Pausing to lie down for a bit.  Refactor complete, works as a scoring machine

Fri Jul 13 18:58:05 PDT 2012
Back.  Going to write some unit tests, of all things.

Fri Jul 13 19:14:10 PDT 2012
Just had a 5 second or so power outage.  Thundering outside.
This may be a problem.

Thank goodness for UPSes.

From chat:
(8:02:21 PM) ems_: mietek: my reading is that if the robot leaves the water, but the rising water covers the robot again in the map update, then this does not reset the waterproofing. However, I haven't tested against the validator.
(8:03:00 PM) Patcdr: I have tested it, and the counter is reset

I'm going to have to fix that... my code currently works like mietak expected.

My ramp-making code seems to be in place, will help with path-finding.

Fri Jul 13 20:58:42 PDT 2012
Going to feed the cats and take another break.

Sat Jul 14 06:22:00 PDT 2012
Eating breakfast, reading icfp mail.  Have ideas about undo and memory usage.

Sat Jul 14 06:53:35 PDT 2012
Done putting Melissa to bed.  Resuming coding.

Sat Jul 14 09:07:20 PDT 2012
Woohoo! Undo works.

Pathing is getting there, but throwing stack overflows in findPath

Sat Jul 14 11:02:05 PDT 2012
Pathing is still throwing stack overflow, but I just got a vision on how to
rework state management to get rid of the side effects, and without consuming
millions of megabytes for large maps.  Need to think about how to best handle
this.  Is the rewrite worth it?

Sat Jul 14 12:51:43 PDT 2012
Rewrite mostly done.  Pausing to feed cats and eat lunch.

Sat Jul 14 13:21:55 PDT 2012
Resuming work on rewrite.

Sat Jul 14 14:33:32 PDT 2012
Immutable state seems to work.

(3:16:30 PM) invisibleimp: When you step onto a razor, _how many_ additional applications become available?
(3:16:41 PM) slindley: just one
(3:16:57 PM) pyjar: is there a maximum number you can carry?
(3:17:03 PM) slindley: no

Sat Jul 14 16:33:07 PDT 2012
Fixed a bunch of stupid glitches in the simulation.

Sat Jul 14 16:48:57 PDT 2012
Prepping for first submission.

Sat Jul 14 17:13:19 PDT 2012
Submission complete.  That was painful.  Hint: don't include the lib dir,
and use Chrome.

Sat Jul 14 19:37:01 PDT 2012
Refactor of priority queue almost complete.  Dinner time.

Sat Jul 14 22:18:24 PDT 2012
Back from dinner.  Time to see if I can get the queue refactor working.

Sat Jul 14 22:44:45 PDT 2012
Queue refactor seems to be working.

Sat Jul 14 23:02:16 PDT 2012
More tweaks to priority, goals.

Sun Jul 15 08:33:32 PDT 2012
It's morning.  have read email, see that the final amendment has been
announced.  I'll be fetching it in a moment.

Priorities for today:
1. Fix approach to lift, so we properly solve map 1.
2. Fix mine representation (again), to eliminate stack overflows with long paths.
3. Update rules to support trampolines, beards, and whatever the final mess is.

Sun Jul 15 09:21:25 PDT 2012
Fixed ramp, still not getting to lift.

Sun Jul 15 09:49:14 PDT 2012
submission: MD5(../icfp-95267072.tgz)= 9ed28ed4033f5979c3110f01a429c2c7

Sun Jul 15 10:00:54 PDT 2012
Added the rest of the sample maps
